# RentEasy Deployment Instructions

This document provides instructions for deploying the RentEasy application.

## Local Storage Data

This application uses your browser's local storage to save user data, property listings, and chat messages. This means:
- The data is stored only on your local machine in your current browser.
- Clearing your browser's cache or site data will erase all information.
- Using the app in a different browser or on a different device will result in a fresh, empty state.

There are no external databases or services to configure for deployment. The app is self-contained and should work immediately after being deployed to a hosting provider like Google Cloud App Hosting.
